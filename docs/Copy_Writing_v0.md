Got it — thanks for the extra details, Abhijeet. This helps make the script feel more authentic and balanced.

Quick recap / confirmation of the full picture now:

- **Tone tweak**: Confident and selective — show eagerness through passion for quality work, but position you as someone who values meaningful roles with good incentives (e.g., "open to opportunities that align with strong growth and fair compensation"). No desperation vibes.
- **Internship**: Frontend Developer Intern (Dec 2025 – present) — we'll highlight it as building real-world skills without overemphasizing length.
- **Projects**: All three have live demos (great for trust). Adding a fourth: the company landing page (a customized "shell" over Empire Revenue Engine, with expanded services/promises). We'll keep projects to four total but concise to avoid overwhelming.
- **Other signals**: 
  - Problem-solving: 100+ LeetCode + 100+ HackerRank (shows grit and fundamentals).
  - Courses: Yes, they absolutely count — they demonstrate structured self-learning in ML (Andrew Ng), full-stack (Angela Hu MERN), and Next.js (Schwarzmüller). We'll weave these in lightly as proof of proactive upskilling.
  - Master's in Math: Awesome for analytical depth (e.g., tying into research/optimization mindset) — frame it as keeping your edge sharp.
  - Blog: Upcoming personal project — mention as a forward-looking note in About to show momentum.
- **Overall**: Still simple language, direct, trust via specifics (links, features, decisions). Site remains scannable for HR/devs.

Sound good? Any tweaks here (e.g., company name for the landing page if you want to name it, or exact demo links to plug in)? If yes, here's the **refined script draft** — I've incorporated everything, kept it punchy, and added a quick "Growth" subsection for the extras without bloating.

**2. About Section** (Short para + bullets — approachable confidence)

As a frontend developer with full-stack exposure, I enjoy turning complex ideas into smooth, reliable apps that people actually use.

Right now, I'm interning as a Frontend Developer (Dec 2025 – present), working on real team projects, code reviews, and iterative builds. It's sharpening my collaboration skills while I continue shipping personal work end-to-end.

What drives me:
- Intuitive UIs with smooth interactions and mobile optimization
- Maintainable code that scales (modular components, state that just works)
- Performance that doesn't compromise on feel (fast loads, accessible flows)

I've tackled 100+ LeetCode and HackerRank problems to stay sharp on algorithms, completed courses like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning (Coursera), Angela Hu's MERN Stack, and Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Next.js — all to build a strong, versatile foundation. Currently pursuing a Master's in Mathematics to keep my analytical skills honed for deeper problem-solving and research-level thinking.

Excited about frontend or full-stack roles (React/Next.js/TS focus) where I can contribute meaningfully, grow with a solid team, and align on fair incentives and impact. (Coming soon: My own blog platform to share dev insights.)

Appreciate you checking it out.

**Notes on changes**:
- Hero/About: Weaves in internship + courses + LeetCode/HackerRank + Master's naturally — shows well-rounded without "resume dump."
- Projects: Added the new one briefly (kept to four; if you want to swap or cut, easy). Emphasizes "what I built" for dev trust.
- Tone: Eager via "excited about" + "passion," but selective with "align on fair incentives and impact" — confident, not needy.
- Length: Still tight — aims for 2–3 min read.

How's this landing for you?  
- Plug in those demo/repo links for the new ones? (E.g., Empire and company page.)  
- Company name for the landing page, or keep it generic?  
- Want more/less on the courses/Master's (e.g., link to certs)?  
- Blog mention feel right, or expand to a "In Progress" teaser?  
- Any section to revise first (e.g., make About shorter)?

Your call — let's iterate until it's spot-on. 😊
